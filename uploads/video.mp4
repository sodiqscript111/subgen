1
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,210
It's getting silent...

2
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,950
We can't use Chokers here.

3
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,070
Get topside and call for backup.

4
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,120
I'll go check on Zanka.

5
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,120
Nice. Seems like he's dealt with them.

6
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,410
Zanka, are you hurt?

7
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,710
What happened to the Raiders?

8
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,770
White hair, black at the tips...

9
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,159
Glaring eyes...

10
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,290
Who are you?

11
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,839
It's you...

12
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,699
The Sphereite Giver!

13
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,060
He's a Raider!

14
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
The exit!

15
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,130
Damn. there's another one of the thieves!

16
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,520
He's one of the Cleaners.

17
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,059
If you're after him,
that means you'll be fighting the Cleaners.

18
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,910
I was running late, y'know.

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,130
I have a bad sense of
dic... I mean, direction.

20
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,779
I was totally lose, but when I finally got
here, the others had been whacked.

21
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,960
I really wasted my time, eh.

22
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,809
Hey, where's Zanka?

23
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,709
There was another Cleaner in the direction
you came from.

24
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,479
- Where... - You see,

25
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,630
there's someone who wants to talk with you.

26
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,880
Would you like to come
with me, Sphereite boy?

27
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,760
Ah!

28
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,850
You don't
need this. There's no Trash Beasts.

29
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,489
Tch!

30
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,560
What
did you do to the Cleaner with the staff?!

31
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,400
Oh, the one with a bad temper?

32
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,680
Fear not. I'm kind to
people who seem strong.

33
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,080
He's just sleeping. I didn't kill him.

34
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,830
But...

35
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:07,580
My poison might have
been a little too strong for him.

36
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,260
If you just
follow me calmly, you won't feel any pain.

37
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,280
What will it be?

38
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,110
You've got the stuff.

39
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,060
I don't need you.

40
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,539
I'll definitely protect my friends.

41
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,040
No matter who I'm up against, I'll protect
them...

42
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,420
I'll protect their value!

43
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,150
Oh, wait...

44
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,600
You must be one of the weaklings
in the Cleaners called a Supporter.

45
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,610
A weakling...

46
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,870
protects?

47
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,900
Hey, Gris... You can't win with bare fists
alone...

48
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,030
We're retreating, right? You don't have to
protect me!

49
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,159
I can defend myself.

50
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,910
Move already!

51
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,280
Sphereite boy.

52
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,540
I don't want you to be sad,

53
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,540
but he's already dead.

54
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,850
What?

55
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,280
But, it's okay.

56
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,700
Weaklings don't have any value!

57
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
GACHIAKUTA

58
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,130
GACHIAKUTA

59
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,950
EPISODE 06: A PROPER STRIKE!

60
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,370
Rudo.

61
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,150
Hey...

62
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
What are you doing?!

63
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,630
Stop that, Rudo!

64
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,010
Why would you hit your head?

65
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,530
You...

66
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,980
told me not to hurt people...

67
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,020
Regto.

68
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,600
That's no reason to hurt yourself...

69
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,960
How'd it come to that?

70
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,190
Rudo.

71
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,439
The
pain in your hands hurts less than before.

72
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,530
I thought you should've calmed down.

73
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,290
You don't even want to meet people.

74
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,879
Tell me what else makes you feel that way.

75
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,070
Let me know!

76
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,950
Nothing.

77
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,570
I have nothing left.

78
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,250
I have... nothing.

79
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,470
It's...

80
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,660
It's always a mess.

81
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,330
Oh...

82
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,600
I do have that.

83
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,350
But...

84
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,340
I don't know what the mess is.

85
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,240
I can't express it.

86
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,450
I see... You...

87
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,660
You
thought you were abandoned by your parents.

88
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,140
That's why you think you're worthless.

89
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,410
That helplessness might
have turned into the mess you're feeling.

90
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,770
And you still don't know how to process it.

91
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,410
Worthless...

92
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,460
What's that?

93
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,980
All right, we're
heading out once we fix your head.

94
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,339
One of the reasons you feel nothing...

95
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,280
is you don't have something you like or
want to do.

96
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,709
Starting today, you should see all kinds of
things and have all kinds of experiences,

97
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,000
and
little by little, find the things you like.

98
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,699
As you continue to do
so, your empty room...

99
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,670
will
eventually be filled with things you love.

100
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,170
If you
want to bring your crush here, just say so.

101
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,680
Promise?

102
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,639
Hmm, it's not that you're not interested in
any of them, but...

103
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,790
You gave the "not quite" feeling to them.

104
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, it's still your first day, anyway.

105
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,530
Regto, what's that?

106
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,660
The city folk is throwing away trash.

107
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,310
Rudo?

108
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,500
Rudo, what's wrong with you?

109
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,490
Did you feel something from that?

110
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,130
No way...

111
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,220
It's just a little broken...

112
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,480
How could he throw this away...

113
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,999
It's still not over yet for this thing!

114
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,660
Poor thing!

115
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,800
I want to fix it...

116
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,520
I want to!

117
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,620
It's self-projection... Or even more.

118
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,040
I guess...

119
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,130
You have
found the value in discarded things.

120
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,290
I see...

121
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,410
That's why he couldn't
use his Vital Instrument back then.

122
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,890
We were under the wrong impression.

123
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,000
Rudo's ability was not the power to turn
objects he touched into Vital Instruments.

124
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,670
It was the power to
unleash the object's true value to the max!

125
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,190
GACHIAKUTA

126
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,350
S-So cool...

127
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,199
That your Vital Instrument?

128
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,909
What it's doing to
you... What kind of power you have...

129
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,760
I don't really get it!

130
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,030
Gris! Hang in there!

131
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,900
Gris, thanks to you, I remember it now.

132
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,890
My roots... The things I originally wanted
to do.

133
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,819
If it weren't for your words,

134
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,439
I would have just snapped like usual,

135
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,150
and nothing would have come of it.

136
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,200
But, I'm different now.

137
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,530
I completely deny what you said,

138
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,090
and I completely affirm what you denied!

139
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,100
And then I'll bring you down!

140
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Rudo...

141
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,909
Wow, you're super pissed.

142
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,759
Nice! You are a strong-willed Giver, eh!

143
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,280
I love people like you!

144
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,360
My name is Jabber. Jabber Wonger.

145
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,010
I feel like
playing with you before taking you with me.

146
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,000
What's your name?

147
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,750
Rudo, you prick.

148
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,750
Okay.

149
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,380
Let's fight to the bitter end, Rudo!

150
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,760
The blood...

151
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,519
Damn! At this rate...

152
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,420
I'll... be fine.

153
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,180
Gris!

154
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:42,630
Rudo... When you were observing, your
inability to use your Vital Instrument...

155
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,639
must be due to various emotions...

156
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,180
such as anxiety and anger getting in the
way of your true nature.

157
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,640
But I guess I needn't worry now.

158
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,609
I thought you were raring
to go at me, but you're not moving at all.

159
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,010
You actually wanna fight?

160
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,949
Come and get me if you can.

161
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,180
You prick.

162
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,589
I told you my name! Call me by my name!

163
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,309
Come on!

164
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,810
Call me Jabber!

165
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,439
Why did you dodge? How boring.

166
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,020
Come on, face me already.

167
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,920
What's going on here?

168
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,850
Did my attacks not hit you?

169
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:56,690
Gris seemed to have prayed for everyone to
go home safely to this talisman.

170
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,749
If he wants them to go home safely,
that means without a scratch, no?

171
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,710
Is strengthening
defence the key to avoiding injury?

172
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,990
This is how I imagined it.

173
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,840
As long as the enemy's attacks don't reach
me.

174
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:18,709
Yeah, sure. It's an ability to enhance your
dodge speed, huh?

175
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,920
Sure is convenient.

176
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,009
But, while my attacks won't hit you,

177
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,260
neither will be yours.

178
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,760
Didn't you notice?

179
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:38,640
I've been dodging your
attacks without moving a muscle.

180
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,200
I'm not the one moving. It's you.

181
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,109
What are you on about?

182
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,200
In other words, I know where you're going.

183
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,409
I can't use this
talisman for offensive purposes.

184
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,460
Because it embodies Gris' prayer.

185
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,470
That's why I'll use Gris' weapon...

186
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,889
I'll smack your face...

187
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,970
with my fist!

188
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,459
You made me mow...

189
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,599
You have such a menacing
look, and a top-tier ability,

190
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,530
but you whacked me with your fist?!

191
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,580
That's super lame!

192
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,219
You wanted to play before taking me home.

193
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,830
Didn't you say that?

194
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,829
I'll play along until
you're in pieces, prick.

195
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,090
Hey, can't you not use
"prick" at the end of your sentence?

196
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,360
I
See. I'm the one getting beat up here, huh?

197
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,349
Don't you feel guilty about hurting people?

198
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,039
Not to you.

199
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,770
Glad to hear that!

200
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,590
He totally noticed that!

201
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,930
You little...

202
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,530
Prick!

203
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,669
That's enough.

204
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,350
Get lost already.

205
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,570
I've never been hit this satisfyingly for a
while!

206
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,580
You must've
had fun hitting me like this, eh!

207
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,660
I gotta have you taste this, too.

208
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,840
I noticed it, though.

209
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,269
Your Vital Instrument...

210
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,100
It has the ability to
sense hostility and avoid attacks...

211
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,300
Isn't it?

212
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,730
You see...

213
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,220
When I tried throwing
the rubble to hide myself, I noticed it.

214
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,890
Your ability...

215
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:47,020
can't react to things
that lack hostility, or rather, willpower.

216
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,520
So what?

217
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,240
My Vital Instrument is Mankira.

218
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,280
My
Right claws contain a powerful neurotoxin.

219
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,390
What are you doing?

220
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,909
Damn, this one always sends me flying!

221
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,800
Oww! I'm going to heaven!

222
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,499
Hey! Hey, Rudo!

223
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,299
Now that my consciousness is flying away,

224
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,829
and I start running wild unconsciously,

225
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:39,490
will your
Vital Instrument interpret it as hostile?!

226
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,380
I can't wait...
